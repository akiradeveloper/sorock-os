# Introduction

After knowing about the concept of \\( \infty \\),
everyone has once used to get addicted to it.

So, scale-out distributed storage is a man's dream.
The performance and the capacity will be infinitely
scaled up by adding more servers to the cluster.

However, in practice, it is not easy to implement a
infinitely scaling out distributed storage when 
node failures should be considered.

The goal of this project **Sorock** is to implement 
a fully automatic perfect scale-out distributed storage
that will never lose data in more than eleven nines SLA level.

The modernest Rust language is chosen to build a quality software.
